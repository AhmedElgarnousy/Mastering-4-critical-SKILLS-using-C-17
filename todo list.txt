Handling the difficulties

* Moving to medium/hard chanllenges 
  . Typically you will fail
  . sometimes fail to solve, but manage to understand the solution


* ToDo list approach 
  . Give a serious trial for the practice & homework (e.g. 30min)
  . Check out my solution 
  . My code will typically be smarter & shorter than yours 
  . Putting effort in understanding my solutions will teach you alot 
  . What is hard to do/understand. put in the todo list and come back later.
