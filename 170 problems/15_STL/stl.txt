Sequence containers:
implement data structures that can be accessed sequentially. 

Associative containers:
implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity). 

Unordered associative containers:
implement unsorted (hashed) data structures that can be quickly searched (O(1)

Container adapters:
provide a different interface for sequential containers.
