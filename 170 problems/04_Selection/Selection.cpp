	Read 2 integers A, B and print based on following cases:
 	 if both are odd print their product A*B
 	 if both are even print their division A/B (assume B != 0)
 	 if the first is odd and the second is even then find their sum A+B
 	 if the first is even and the second is odd then find their subtraction A-B
	Level: Easy Challenge
