        Description: Problem #4: Is Prime?
        Read an integer N (< 500) and print YES if it is prime, otherwise NO
        A prime number is greater than 1 AND cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller numbers.
            In other words, number%whatever != 0
            The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.
