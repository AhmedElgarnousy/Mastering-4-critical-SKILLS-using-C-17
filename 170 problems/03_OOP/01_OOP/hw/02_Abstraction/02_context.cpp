Recall: Abstraction is about hiding unwanted details while showing most 
essential in a given context
- Context helps us define what is really relevant
- Let’s say our department has 3 separate projects
- Kindergarten Application, College School Application, College’s gym Application
- Each application has its own Student class
- Think in a few common data-members for each case for its own student class
- Think in 1 unique feature for each case
